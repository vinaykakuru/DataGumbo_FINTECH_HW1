## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? 
    * Historically, the pricing in Oil & Gas drilling services sector was based on either day-rate and footage rate.
        * **Day-Rate issue**: Longer a service provider takes to complete a well, higher the cost for customer and more revenue for service provider.
        * **Footage-Rate issue**: Faster, or more efficient, the service provider is, same revenue for service provider and significant savings for the operator.

    * DataGumbo is providing a platfrom to facilitate performace-based pricing, where customer savings (time & money) due to improved operational efficiencies can be fairly split across all stake-holders.

* Who is the company's intended customer? 
    * Oil & Gas operators, rig contractors and service providers

* Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers
    * No pubilic information is available regarding the market size
    * However based on my estimates, cost savings in USA alone could be around $1.8B to 2.4B.
        * Approximaty $6 – 8B is spent in US renting drilling rigs (Split: 75% Land; 25% Offshore]
